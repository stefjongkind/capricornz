Description
===============

This plugin is replicates the base Rails scaffolding but
produces views in Markaby instead of ERB. It creates a
MarkabyHelper class as a starting point for writing your
own Markaby helpers.

It also monkey patches Rails 2.0.2 to fix
http://code.whytheluckystiff.net/markaby/ticket/58.

Requires that Markaby plugin is installed.

Examples
=============

./script/generate markaby_scaffold post # no attributes, view will be anemic
./script/generate markaby_scaffold post title:string body:text published:boolean
./script/generate markaby_scaffold purchase order_id:integer amount:decimal
